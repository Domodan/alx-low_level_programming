> 0. 0 - convert a binary number to an unsigned int.
> 1. 1 - prints the binary representation of a number.
> 2. 10 - returns the value of a bit at a given index.
> 3. 11 - sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
> 4. 100 - sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
> 5. 101 - returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
> 6.  Inception. Is it possible?
> 7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything
> 8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...
